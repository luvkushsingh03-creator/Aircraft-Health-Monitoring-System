✈ AI-Based Aircraft Health Monitoring System

 📌 Project Overview::
This project implements an AI-driven aircraft health monitoring system that analyzes telemetry sensor data to predict the health status of aircraft systems. The goal is to assist in pre-flight inspections and support predictive maintenance decisions using machine learning.
The system processes structured telemetry inputs such as engine temperature, vibration levels, fuel pressure, and RPM to determine whether the aircraft condition is **Normal** or **Requires Attention**.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
**Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier  

Why Random Forest?
- Handles multiple telemetry parameters effectively
- Robust to noise and outliers
- Provides high accuracy on structured tabular data
- Reduces overfitting through ensemble learning
- Works well for classification problems with nonlinear relationships


 📊 Features Used
- Engine Temperature  
- Fuel Pressure  
- Oil Pressure  
- Vibration Level  
- Engine RPM  
- Flight Hours


 ⚙ How to Run the Project
1. Install required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the system:
   untitled-1.py or untitled-2.py

3. Select:
